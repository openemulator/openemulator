==1.0.4==
* Add F12 reset key
* Fix crash when replacing monitors
* Fix crash when writing to a DSK file
* Fix writing to DOS 3.1 or DOS 3.2 NIB files
* Modify CTRL+ALT -> Mouse message to "Press CTRL+OPTION to release mouse."
* Modify power/reset toolbar into a global emulation property
* Fix Disk II sounds
* Fix Apple Silentype Interface Card spurious data problems
* Implement Apple Silentype print intensity
* Fix [CanvasView update] problem in paper view
* Add Apple Silentype sounds
* Add Apple Graphics Tablet sounds
* Implement DDL file format
* Implement Apple III
* Implement wxWidgets user interface
* Implement open disk image with template chooser
* Implement Apple speaker tension/relax audio driver
* Fix Disk II for: Sherwood Forest, IAC 45, Alkemstone, EOS, Last Gladiator, Wasteland
* Refactorize PAAudio so an emulation is stopped while it is being configured. Increase thread priority
* Mac OS X: fix window resizing when loading from disk (confusing emulation window size with canvas window size)

==1.0.5==
* Implement Saturn RAMboard
* Implement Apple IIe
* Implement Apple II Memory Expansion Card
* Implement AE RamWorks
* Implement Thunderclock Plus
* Implement AE TransWarp
* Implement Microsoft Softcard
* Implement ZIP Chip
* Implement Mountain Computer Apple Clock
* Implement TimeMaster II H.O.
* Implement Apple II Super Serial Card
* Think of a way to implement a server that can be separated into the UNIX command line, like responding to calls using netcat (it should separate command and data mode, be able to dial with ATD, and respond with ATA, hang up with ATH. Send messages like OK, RING, CONNECT and NO CARRIER). It might also have set DCD when connected. Respond to "+++" and 1 second wait.
* Implement a virtual RS-232 SSH client. In client mode, displays "host: ", "login as: " and "user@host's password: " to connect remotely to SSH. In modem mode, ATD commands are accepted.
* Implement a virtual RS-232 SSH server that listens on a port. A user and password can be configured.
* Implement a virtual RS-232 file device. When reading, it reads from file. When writing, it writes to a file.
* Implement a virtual RS-232 speech synthesizer and recognizer device. It uses the host speech synthesis and speech recognition.
* Fix CTRL+ALT mouse capture problems (bug report, unverified)

==1.0.6==
* Implement Digisector DS-65
* Implement Apple IIc FF
* Implement Apple IIc 00
* Implement Apple IIc 01
* Implement Apple IIc 03
* Implement Apple IIc plus
* Implement Mountain Computer SuperTalker
* Implement Mountain Computer Music System
* Implement MIDI Card
* Implement Mockingboard

==1.0.7==
* Implement Apple IIGS ROM00, ROM01, ROM03

==Framework==
* Fix persistence when powering down and restarting an emulation
* Implement RGB>YIQ>RGB video processing in the GPU
* Implement video bloom
* Add OESound: resampling, rendering to audio buffer
* Find an elegant way for ROM images to be stored in packages... use RAM block and read-only memory mapping? No. Add "imageInPackage" property to the ROM component.
* Do disk image file locking if the disk image is writable (flock)
* TCP AT Modem emulation
* Add debugging ˆ la JTAG with gdb commands in a separate terminal
* Implement frame interpolation with sinc function
* Remove data property, and replace with value property that references the filename. Thus the interface for opening files is unified, and we don't have to exchange buffers. Implement an OEData class that is capable of reading from/writing to file. How could OEData get the handle to a zip package? How could we write back the file?

==GUI==
* Fix Cocoa initial window sizes
* Implement Cocoa canvas positioning in upper left
* Fix opening emulations (sometimes dragging disk images to canvas opens the template chooser)
* Implement UNICODE entry of composed keys on Mac OS X (like ^ or « or `)
* Fix scrolling in template chooser when changing group
* CanvasWindow in fullscreen mode could have multiple display sizes (e.g. for the Macintosh 512x342 window)
* Add search in template chooser
